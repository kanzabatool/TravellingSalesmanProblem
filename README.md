# TravellingSalesmanProblem

In this report, a network of a hiking trail map famously
known as the Sleeping Giant park located in the town of
Hamden in Connecticut, United States, is explored. The
Travelling Salesman Problem(TSP) technique is applied
on the data set of the Sleeping Giant hiking trail route
map consisting of edges(trails) and nodes(objects) to find
the best possible strategy for a hiker to move from node to
node forming a minimum-cost Eulerian tour of the computed
graph. The dataset is also analyzed to find the
higher priority nodes using the centrality measures of high
order degrees and betweenness.
